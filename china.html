                <div class="c_box_sub_detail_p"><p>Located in Luoyang, Henan Province located in central China, the Longmen Grottoes is famed as the biggest grottoes in China, containing the most amount of Buddha sculptures. Firstly being built in 493AD, this huge project lasted about 1,400 years and ended during the Qing Dynasty.The carvings and workmanship are outstanding. Ancient Buddha sculptures dot the caves yielding up surprises at every turn. About 25% of the 100,000 statues are undamaged. The largest statue was commissioned by the first female emperor of China - Wu ZeTian. The grottoes extend for more than one kilometer along the bank of the Yihe River. It’s well worth crossing the bridge to view the grotto from the other side to get a wide-angle perspective of the whole grotto. It is recommended to visit the site in the morning, as when the sun goes down at the back of the mountain, the statues are darkened.</p></div>
