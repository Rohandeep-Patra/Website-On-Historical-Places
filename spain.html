                <div class="c_box_sub_detail_p"><p>Calat Alhambra or the “Red Fortress” in Granada is an incredible complex of royal palaces, mosques, baths, shops and other buildings surrounded by an imposing 2 kilometre fortified wall.

                    Today, the Alhambra is open to the public. You can tour its palaces, including the Palacio Nazaríes and the 16th century Palace of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. The Alcazaba or “citadel” is another highlight of the Alhambra, this being the main element of the complex’s fortifications.
                    
                    The Alhambra is centred on two main courtyards: the Court of the Lions and the Court of Myrtles, the former with a fountain and the latter with a long pool. Its beautiful Generalife gardens and buildings are also worth visiting, while the Alhambra Museum offers everything from Nasrid art to archaeological finds.</p></div>

                <div class="c_box_sub_detail_p"><p>eville Cathedral is the third largest cathedral in the world, a World Heritage site and the resting place of colonial explorer, Christopher Columbus.

                    An impressive gothic structure and, with a total area of 11,520 square metres, Seville Cathedral is only beaten in size by London’s St Paul’s Cathedral and Rome’s St. Peter’s. Some even argue that it is actually the largest when comparing volume.
                    
                    Designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987, the cathedral is an incredible historic site where visitors can appreciate the sheer scale of the building from inside, including its central nave which stands at a grand forty metres high. With its ornate, gold-laden interiors and eighty chapels, the scale of Seville Cathedral alone is quite a sight, coupled with the wealth of architectural influences, ranging from Gothic and Baroque to Mudejar.</p></div>

                <div class="c_box_sub_detail_p"><p>Santa Eulalia Basilica in Merida is an Ancient Roman church the remains of which lie under the present 18th century church.

                    The namesake of Santa Eulalia Basilica was a 13 year-old girl who was martyred upon being burnt at the stake during the Christian persecutions under Emperor Diocletian. According to legend, she is buried nearby.
                    
                    The Santa Eulalia Basilica’s particularly interesting feature is the crypt, within which you can see the 20 centuries of Merida’s history through the Roman mausoleums, a tomb sealed with mosaics, or tombs from the Visigoth period sealed with marble.</p></div>

                <div class="c_box_sub_detail_p"><p>Intended to mark the celebration of Spain’s victory over the French in the Battle of St Quentin, El Escorial was constructed between 1563 and 1567 by Juan Bautista de Toledo, a Spanish architect who had spent much of his career in Rome. It would go on to serve as the king’s palace and the seat of his empire.

                    The basilica is the central part of the complex: look out for the gorgeous white Carrara marble statues and paintings by El Greco, amongst other 16th, 17th and 18th Spanish and Flemish artists.
                    
                    It’s worth getting a map and plotting out highlights – there’s a vast amount to see in the imposing buildings and you can easily spend a day here.</p></div>

                <div class="c_box_sub_detail_p"><p>El Miguelete (The Micalet Tower) is an iconic gothic bell tower built in 1381 and joined onto Valencia Cathedral in the 15th century. El Miguelete means ‘Little Michael’ and comes from the name of its biggest bell made in 1532 weighing over 10 tons.

                    Construction of the Valancian cathedral’s bell tower, El Miguelete, began in 1381 directed by master builder Andreu Julià of the Valencian Gothic style. The imposing design and size of the cathedral and bell tower reasserted Valencia’s Christian identity after Muslim dominance from the 8th to mid 13th century.
                    
                    However, it was El Miguelete’s complex design, including a helical stairwell and fine mouldings, that meant the tower took a long time to constructH</p></div>
