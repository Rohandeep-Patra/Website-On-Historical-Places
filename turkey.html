                <div class="c_box_sub_detail_p"><p>The Hagia Sophia, or ‘Ayasofya’ in Turkish, is a world-famous 6th century church-turned-mosque in Istanbul, whose blended architectural styles and vast proportions have installed it as Turkey’s most-visited attraction.

                    Today the Hagia Sophia functions as a mosque yet allows visitors of all faiths and nationalities through its doors. Remnants of the first two Hagia Sophias may be viewed as well as the current building with its vast domed ceiling and ornate Muslim altars and chapels.</p></div>

                <div class="c_box_sub_detail_p"><p>Ephesus, or ‘Efes’, was a vibrant classical city which now borders modern day Selçuk in Turkey. It represents some of the best preserved Greek and Roman ruins in the Mediterranean. Today, visitors can enjoy exploring the numerous ruins alongside enjoying the museum which houses many artefacts discovered at the site.

                    Today, Ephesus is a treasure trove for enthusiasts of Ancient Roman and Greek history, allowing them to walk through its streets and view its magnificent houses, community buildings, temples and stadiums.</p></div>

                <div class="c_box_sub_detail_p"><p>Topkapı Palace was the seat and residence of the sultans of the Ottoman Empire. Built in a traditional Ottoman style, Topkapi Palace measured a staggering 700,000 metres squared in volume upon its construction, made up of a series of courtyards, the main palace and several ancillary buildings.

                    Today, it is a popular tourist destination, with visitors flocking to see its Ottoman architecture, courtyards and Muslim and Christian relics, even including the belongings of the Prophet Mohammed.</p></div>

                <div class="c_box_sub_detail_p"><p>The Cappadocia Underground Cities are a series of magnificent subterranean cities built by the ‘cave goers’. Of the almost forty known Cappadocia underground cities, some in Nevshir are open to the public, including Kaymaklı, Derinkuyu, Özkonak, Mazi and Ürgüp.

                    The most incredible aspects of the underground cities are their sheer scale and complexity. Some of them delve eight levels underground, with comprehensive living quarters and facilities for making grape juice, cooking, drainage and plumbing and even stables for horses. Visiting the cities is an exciting, authentic and fascinating journey.</p></div>

                <div class="c_box_sub_detail_p"><p>The Blue Mosque was the ambitious creation of a young sultan and would become one of Istanbul’s most iconic sites. When it was completed in 1616, the Blue Mosque was a worthy neighbour of the Hagia Sofia. With its hierarchy of increasingly large domes, this vast complex helped define the city’s skyline.

                    The interior of the Blue Mosque is just as grand and ornate. Furthermore, a journey into the interior of the Blue Mosque reveals the reason behind its alternate name – the swathes of blue tiles which adorn its walls.</p></div>
