                <div class="c_box_sub_detail_p"><p>The Brandenburg Gate is a famous landmark in Berlin built between 1788 and 1791 which once served as a city gateway. Commissioned by King Frederick William II of Prussia it stood in the entrance to boulevard Unter den Linden, which led to the city palace.

                    The gate was reopened on December 22, 1989, in the course of the reunification of East and West Berlin, when West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl walked through it to meet East German Prime Minister Hans Modrow. Following the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Brandenburg gate became a symbol of German reunification.</p></div>

                <div class="c_box_sub_detail_p"><p>The Reichstag is one of Berlin’s most significant historical buildings, having borne silent witness to the turbulent history not just of Berlin, but wider Germany. It is also the current home of the German parliament.

                    Designed by architect Paul Wallot during the reign of Emperor Wilhelm I, the Reichstag contained several pioneering architectural elements, including a steel and glass copula – the first of its kind.</p></div>

                <div class="c_box_sub_detail_p"><p>Cologne Cathedral (Kölner Dom) is a vast and impressive gothic cathedral which took over 600 years to complete. Visible from nearly every point in the city, it is the second highest building in Cologne.

                    Located on what was previously the site of a Roman villa, thought to have dated back to the 4th century – as well as several increasingly larger churches – construction of the current Cologne Cathedral began in 1248.</p></div>

                <div class="c_box_sub_detail_p"><p>If Holstentor looks familiar, this might be because you have glimpsed it on a German 2 Euro coin. Built in the 15th century, Holstentor (also known as Holsten Tor or Holsten Gate) was part of the medieval defences of the Hanseatic city of Lübeck and is one of only 2 of the original 4 gates of the city, the other being Burgtor.

                    Today, Holstentor is one of a long list of buildings included as part of the UNESCO Hanseatic City of Lubeck site. Looking like it has come straight out of a fairytale, inside this medieval gem is the city museum of Lübeck.</p></div>

                <div class="c_box_sub_detail_p"><p>Called the ‘castle above all castles’, the Würzburg Residence in Germany was principally designed by little-known court architect Balthasar Neumann and commissioned by Johann Philipp Franz von Schönborn, Prince-Bishop of Würzburg.

                    According to UNESCO – for which Würzburg was inscribed as a World Heritage Site in 1981 – the “Residence is a document of European culture. Perhaps no monument from the same period is able to claim such a concurrence of talent”.</p></div>
