                <div class="c_box_sub_detail_p"><p>The church atop Mont-Saint-Michel was built as early as the 8th century, and if you ask the right people they’ll tell you this was by order of the Archangel Michael himself. Throughout the years that followed its construction, other buildings and streets went up on the steeps alongside it until Mont-Saint-Michel eventually became a little town, and much later named a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

                    Today it has been a major pilgrimage destination for centuries, not to mention a hit with the tourists. It lies in the bay where Brittany and Normandy merge, seemingly free-floating on days of high tide. For hundreds of years, the causeway between the mont and the mainland was only uncovered at low tide. These days there is a light bridge crossing which allows the ocean to ebb and flow around it, only covering the path on the occasional “supertide”.</p></div>

                <div class="c_box_sub_detail_p"><p>Père Lachaise Cemetery is both the largest park and the largest cemetery in Paris. It was founded in 1804 and has since expanded across 44 hectares of land. These grounds hold 70,000 marked burial plots, but nobody knows for sure how many people have been buried here over the years (educated guesses range from 300,000 to 1,000,000). One thing is for sure, however: a myriad of celebrities have found their eternal resting place at Père Lachaise… As you wander through the seemingly endless maze of curious-looking plots, ranging from gothic graves to Haussmann chambers and ancient mausoleums, you’ll come across more than one recognizable name. The list includes Honoré de Balzac, Guillaume Apollinaire, Frédéric Chopin, Colette, Jean-François Champollion, Jean de La Fontaine, Molière, Yves Montand, Simone Signoret, Jim Morrison, Alfred de Musset, Edith Piaf, Camille Pissarro and Oscar Wilde, just to name a few…</p></div>

                <div class="c_box_sub_detail_p"><p>n the years of that great empire, Nîmes Arena was home to the traditional Roman games. Its enchanting elliptical shape gave unobstructed views of the performances to 20,000 spectators who accommodated on the 34 seated rows. The arena’s two levels and surmounting attic are covered by sixty stone arches, and a whole network of galleries with no less than 126 staircases that lead visitors to their seats.

                    When the Roman Empire was no more, the Visigoths transformed the Nîmes Arena into a fortress. Later, during the middle ages, a small village was erected within its walls, complete with wells, houses, churches and a castle. These structures remained until the 18th century when a subsequent deconstruction began. The Prefect of the Guard authorized the first bull races in 1813, allowing the arena to fulfil its original function once more. To this day, bullfighting can be viewed there during the Feria of Nîmes.</p></div>

                <div class="c_box_sub_detail_p"><p>The life-changing discovery of a French teenager and his young friends in the 1940’s, the Lascaux caves contain over six-hundred paintings of animals from the Upper Palaeolithic time. The paintings which cover the cave’s walls and ceilings are tentatively estimated to be about 17,000 years old, an ongoing art-project of several generations.

                    Lascaux opened to the public after World War II, but as visitor numbers rose to around 1500 a day, the large amounts of carbon dioxide exuded by the human breath began to damage the art. Thus, the original Lascaux cave closed in 1963 and now only accessible to an increasingly small number of scientist and field experts every year. Visitors are instead invited to explore the nearby replica of the caves, as it has been reconstructed down to every detail. Professional guides will accompany groups of visitors several times a day leading tours and answer questions about the cave’s curiosities.</p></div>

                <div class="c_box_sub_detail_p"><p>Twenty metres below ground, underneath the heart of beautiful Paris, is a hidden labyrinth. This winding maze of narrow passages and dark galleries was built centuries ago, out of the old quarries whose stone was used to construct the city. They contain the remains of millions of Parisians, transferred from their original resting places when the city’s graveyards, a threat to public health, were being closed during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

                    The bones in the ossuary are arranged into a rather macabre display of typical Romantic tastes and visitors are greeted by the verse “Arrête, c’est ici l’empire de la mort” (Halt, this is the realm of Death) as they enter the two-kilometre route through the catacombs. The tour takes around 45 minutes to complete and it’s quite the sight to see, but definitely not one for the squeamish.</p></div>
