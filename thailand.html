                <div class="c_box_sub_detail_p"><p>Ayutthaya was an ancient city in Thailand whose beautiful ruins stand as a testament to this once thriving port settlement. Visitors can still view Ayutthaya’s many Buddha statues, its giant complex of temples which once numbered an estimated four hundred and three palaces.

                    Perhaps the best way to get around in Ayutthaya is by bicycle, with its many cycling routes providing a natural itinerary. Ayutthaya is usually an entire day’s trip, particularly for those coming from Bangkok and tours are available.</p></div>

                <div class="c_box_sub_detail_p"><p>The Grand Palace in Bangkok has been a royal residence of the Chakri Dynasty since the reign of that house’s first monarch, King Rama I. With its beautiful Thai-style architecture and spanning over 200,000 square metres, the Grand Palace is one of the foremost tourist attractions in Thailand.

                    The Grand Palace is actually made up of a series of buildings, including government offices, monasteries and a museum and a visit can last three or four hours. The rest of the complex is divided into two sections called the inner and outer courts, most of which are out of bounds to the public. It can help to hire a guide beforehand if you want to learn about the Grand Palace history and make absolutely sure you abide by the strict dress code (no shorts, mini skirts, short sleeves, sandals or tight trousers).</p></div>

            <div class="c_box_sub_detail_h1"><h1>Ancient Siam</h1></div>
                <div class="c_box_sub_detail_p"><p>Ancient Siam is a privately owned museum and reportedly the world’s largest outdoor museum. Shaped like Thailand, Ancient Siam is almost an entire recreation of the country with miniature replicas and reconstructions of most of its important sites in the correct locations.

                    Whilst Ancient Siam does contain some original artifacts, the appeal of this little known attraction lies not in its authenticity, but in the overview it provides of Thai history and the attention to detail in recreating national treasures. Amongst its recreations, visitors can see The Tiger King’s Palace of Phetchaburi, The Ancient Theatrical Pavilion, The Royal Stand and many more.</p></div>

                <div class="c_box_sub_detail_p"><p>Wat Pratat Doi Suthep is a Buddhist Theravada temple and sacred site in Thailand. The exact origins of this ornate temple are uncertain, although several legends testify to its beginnings.

                    Otherwise, it is generally believed to date back to 1383 when the first stupa was built there, and has since been expanded over time.
                    
                    Today, Wat Pratat Doi Suthep is a sumptuously decorated temple reached by a climb up 309 steps. Don’t worry if you are not keen on the climb, as a tram will also take you up to the pagodas. Standing at the site is also a large white elephant statue commemorating the founding myth.</p></div>

                <div class="c_box_sub_detail_p"><p>Over 1,000 years old and built on the edge of an extinct volcano at 402 metres about sea-level, Phanom Rung is the best preserved and most impressive Khmer Hindu temple complex in Thailand.

                    Today, you enter the site along a 160 metre-long processional walkway leading to the temple, with incredible views of the main tower. A pavilion on the right hand side of the walkway was built for the King to prepare himself for ceremonies in the temple. At the end of the walkway you reach the Naga Bridge, symbolising your passing from the earthly world into the world of the Gods… </p></div>
